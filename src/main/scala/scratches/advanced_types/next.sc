// Advanced types:

// Higher-Kinded Types (HKT): Start by getting comfortable with higher-kinded types, which are types that abstract over other types. These will come up frequently in advanced Scala patterns and libraries.
//
// Recursive Types: Recursive types are useful for understanding data structures that refer to themselves, such as linked lists or trees. It's a good practice for learning how to model complex structures in a type-safe manner.
//
// Structural Types: Structural types allow you to describe a type by its behavior, not its specific implementation, a concept akin to duck typing in dynamically typed languages. They are quite different from the other types and will make you think about types from a new perspective.
//
// Phantom Types: Phantom types let you carry extra information at the type level and can help catch more bugs at compile time. Learning how to use them effectively will start to push you into type-level programming.
//
// Existential Types: Existential types allow you to express uncertainty about the type of some values, offering a kind of 'type wildcard'. This concept will challenge you to think more abstractly about types.
//
//  F-Bounded Types: F-bounded types enable more precise typing for scenarios where a type or class refers to itself in its declaration. It's an interesting model for expressing certain kinds of constraints in your programs.
//
// Path-Dependent Types: Path-dependent types, which allow for types that are 'scoped' to a containing object, are a stepping stone towards the powerful concept of dependent types. They will further deepen your understanding of Scala's type system.
//
// Aux Pattern: Finally, learning the Aux pattern will equip you with a practical pattern to solve issues arising from complex type inference situations in Scala. This pattern ties together many of the concepts you've learned along the way.
