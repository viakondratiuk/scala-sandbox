  A. Hierarchy and Related Concepts

  Often we work with collections as an abstract and concrete implementation is:
   Seq, Set, Map
   Depending on a task we need to have fast access, search or uniqueness.
   Also mutability or immutability.

   A container with data.
   Seq - Linear(List) or Indexed(Array), Vectot
   Set - is unique
   Map - HashMap with fast access

  B. What problem solves? Abstract and Real

  Process all users from database, compute avg salary, find min country size

  /**
  D. Bloom Taxonomy
	- Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyse, Evaluate, Create

	- Apply is interpretation, sketching where the concept fits
	- Analyze is comparing and contrasting other concepts and facts to new information
	- Evaluate is discriminating which connections between concepts are the most important.
