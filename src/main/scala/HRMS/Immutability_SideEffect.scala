  A. Hierarchy and Related Concepts

  Related to FP, gives us a possibility to design function as \
   in math
   Pure function - for same input produces same output, all other side effects
   change state, read file o db, write, reflect, global vars, calling impure
   immutable structure guarantee that we not changing a state
   we are not changing objects but creating new one

  D. Bloom Taxonomy
	- Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyse, Evaluate, Create

	- Evaluate is discriminating which connections between concepts are the most important.
